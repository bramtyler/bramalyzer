I coded this visualizer in Processing, a language similar to Java developed by MIT graduates. 
It has a center circle that expands with the volume of the music, generally with the beat and a 
logo inside the circle that does so similarly. There are lines that go to the center circle from 
the edges of the screen that wildly change based on the frequency of the music. There are bars at 
the bottom of the screen that change height based on the frequency and volume as well. Last, randomly 
generated particles emerge from the center behind the logo creating a cool, snowy effect. They move 
towards the outer edges of the screen at a certain speed that also depends on the volume of the 
music.
